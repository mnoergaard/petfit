# Troubleshooting

## Data and file issues

### No TAC files found

**Symptom:** The region definition app shows no files.

**Cause:** TAC files are missing the `seg` or `label` BIDS entity in their filenames. PETFit filters out files that have neither.

**Fix:** Ensure your TAC filenames include a `seg-*` or `label-*` entity, e.g. `sub-01_seg-gtm_tacs.tsv`.

### TACs and morph file mismatch

**Symptom:** Regions are combined with equal weighting (volume = 1) instead of actual volumes.

**Cause:** No matching morph file was found. The `sub` and `seg`/`label` entities must match exactly (case-sensitive) between TAC and morph files.

**Fix:** Check that the morph file exists and has matching `sub` and `seg`/`label` values. PETFit will show a warning when falling back to equal weighting.

### Combined TACs not generated

**Symptom:** Error during region combination.

**Cause:** Likely a column name issue. If you see errors about columns like `volume.mm3`, this is a file reading issue — `readr::read_tsv()` preserves hyphens in column names (e.g. `volume-mm3`), while base R `read.table()` converts them to dots.

**Fix:** This should not occur with the current version of PETFit. If it does, please [report the issue](https://github.com/mathesong/petfit/issues).

### Subject IDs appear as numbers instead of strings

**Symptom:** Subject IDs like `01` are displayed as `1`.

**Cause:** This happens when files are read with base R functions that convert character columns to numeric.

**Fix:** PETFit uses `readr::read_tsv()` which preserves character types. If you see this issue, please report it.

### BIDS entity ordering in petfit_regions.tsv

**Symptom:** Region definition fails to match files.

**Cause:** The description column in `petfit_regions.tsv` must use the correct BIDS entity ordering. PETFit gives priority to `seg`/`label`, then sorts remaining keys alphabetically.

**Fix:** Use `seg-gtm_desc-preproc` rather than `desc-preproc_seg-gtm`.

## Reference tissue issues

### Reference region not found in analysis data

**Symptom:** Error during reference TAC setup or model fitting.

**Cause:** The reference region specified in `ReferenceTAC.region` is not included in the data subsetting.

**Fix:** Make sure the Regions field in the Subsetting section includes your reference region. For example, if your reference region is "Cerebellum", then Regions must include "Cerebellum".

## Report issues

### Report generation fails

**Symptom:** Error when generating HTML reports.

**Possible causes:**
- Missing template files in `inst/rmd/`
- Missing R dependencies (`rmarkdown`, `knitr`, `plotly`)
- Corrupt or incomplete data in the analysis folder

**Fix:** Check that all dependencies are installed. Try rendering the report manually:

```r
rmarkdown::render(
  system.file("rmd", "2tcm_report.Rmd", package = "petfit"),
  params = list(analysis_folder = "/path/to/analysis")
)
```

## Model fitting issues

### Model fails to converge

**Symptom:** Model fitting produces `NA` values or error messages about convergence.

**Possible causes:**
- Parameter bounds too narrow or too wide
- Poor start values
- Noisy or unusual TAC data
- Insufficient time frames for the model complexity

**Fix:** Try adjusting parameter bounds and start values in the model configuration. For compartmental models, ensure bounds are physiologically reasonable. Check the TAC data in the interactive tab to verify it looks sensible before fitting.

### Unexpected parameter estimates

**Symptom:** Fitted parameters are at their boundary values or seem implausible.

**Cause:** The optimiser may be hitting parameter bounds, or the data may not support the chosen model.

**Fix:** Review the model fit plots in the HTML reports. Consider whether a simpler model might be more appropriate (e.g. 1TCM instead of 2TCM). Widen parameter bounds if estimates are consistently hitting limits.

## Ancillary analysis issues

### Ancillary folder not found

**Symptom:** Error message about missing ancillary analysis folder.

**Cause:** The `ancillary_analysis_folder` must be a sibling folder name (e.g. `"Ancillary_Analysis"`), not a full path. It must already exist under `derivatives/petfit/`.

**Fix:** Ensure the ancillary analysis has been run first and the folder exists. Pass only the folder name, not a path.

### Missing delay or k2prime files in ancillary folder

**Symptom:** Pipeline cannot find expected parameter files in the ancillary folder.

**Cause:** The ancillary analysis did not complete the relevant step (delay fitting or model fitting), or the files are named differently than expected.

**Fix:** Check that the ancillary analysis ran successfully by reviewing its reports. Delay files should match `*_desc-delayfit_kinpar.tsv` and model files should match `*_desc-model{N}_kinpar.tsv`.

## Docker issues

### Output files owned by root

On Linux, Docker containers run as root by default. Add `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` to your `docker run` command. See [Docker usage](containers/docker.md#file-permissions-on-linux).

### Port already in use

Map to a different host port: `-p 8080:3838` instead of `-p 3838:3838`.

## Apptainer / HPC issues

### No internet access on compute nodes

Build the container on a login node, then transfer the `.sif` file to your project space.

### Home directory size limits

Set `APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` to a scratch directory:

```bash
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/scratch/$USER/apptainer_cache
```

### Finding the Apptainer module

Common module names:

```bash
module load apptainer
module load singularity
module load singularity-ce
```

See [Apptainer troubleshooting](containers/apptainer.md#troubleshooting) for more details.
